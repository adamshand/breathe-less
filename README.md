# 🌬️ Breathe Less

Breathe Less is a timer and progress tracking app for the Buteyko Method's
Maximum Pause exercise.

I built this app because I wanted a way to track my progress visually, and got
nerd rage from constantly starting and stopping timers manually. I’ve been using
it every day since June 2025.

You can use it for free at: https://breathe.adam.nz

## Features

- Provides automatic timers with audible alerts for taking pulse, shallow
  breathing sessions, recovery periods, and measuring your control & maximum
  pause.
- All session data is saved. This creates a practice diary which can be easily
  shared with a teacher.
- Session data is private. Nothing is sent to a 3rd party (except normal web
  stats).
- A simple chart is provided to help you track progress and detect stalls.
- Session data can be imported and exported in CSV format.
- Can be installed as an app on mobile devices and browsers which support PWAs
  (progressive web apps).
- Can be used offline without an internet connection.

## Technical Details

- Written using the JavaScript framework SvelteKit.
- It is a PWA (progressive web app).
- Practice data is stored inside the web browser using IndexedDB.
- Web stats are collected using the open source project
